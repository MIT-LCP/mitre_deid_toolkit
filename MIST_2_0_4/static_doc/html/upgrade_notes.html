    <h1>Upgrade Notes</h1>
    <p>If you've received a previous version of MAT, this page contains
      instructions on how to upgrade to the new version.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Upgrading from version 1.3 to version 2.0</h2>
    <h3>New features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>All non-automated components now handle annotation
          attributes</b>: Attributes can be strings, ints, floats,
        booleans,&nbsp; or other annotations, or set or list
        aggregations of these types. Strings and ints support choice
        lists; annotation attributes support type restrictions; ints and
        floats support range restrictions. All attributes other than
        annotations support default values.<br>
      </li>
      <li><b>All non-automated components now handle spanless
          annotations</b>: These annotations have no direct anchor in
        the text, and can be used to model relations, coreference
        entities, and other elements.<br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Scorer now handles document-internal overlaps</b>: In
        version 1.3, <a href="MATScore.html">MATScore</a> did not deal
        with documents which contained internal content annotation
        overlaps. In 2.0, we've implemented a sophisticated annotation
        matching algorithm which addresses this issue.</li>
      <li><b>Scorer is now customizable in task.xml</b>: You can declare
        which dimensions of annotations will be compared when
        annotations are compared; how those dimensions will be compared;
        and what the weight of each dimension is.<br>
      </li>
      <li><b>New transducer tool now available</b>: In previous
        versions, if you simply wanted to convert documents from one
        format to another, you'd use <a href="MATEngine.html">MATEngine</a>.
        The problem with MATEngine is that it requires a task; it only
        succeeds if all documents can be processed; and it requires a
        workflow. There's now a new tool, <a href="MATTransducer.html">MATTransducer</a>,
        which addresses all these issues. The transducer also supports a
        new XML-driven <a href="doc_conversion_xml.html">annotation
          conversion language</a>.<br>
      </li>
      <li><b>All tools now support better temporary file management</b>:
        In 2.0, every command-line tool which invokes a subprocess
        (e.g., the Carafe tagger) now takes the --tmpdir_root and
        --preserve_tempfiles options, which gives you better control
        over debugging and the placement of temporary files created
        during processing.</li>
      <li><b>MAT JSON format has been expanded</b>: To support its
        expanded annotation and attribute model, MAT 2.0 now uses
        version 2 of the <a href="mat_json_format.html">MAT JSON
          document format</a> by default. All readers recognize previous
        versions of the format as well. We've also introduced a new
        writer, mat-json-v1, to allow users to save documents in the
        format used by MAT 1.3.</li>
      <li><b>New span reconciliation capability</b>: In MAT 2.0, we've
        deployed a tool for <a href="ui_reconciliation.html">reconciliation


          of simple span annotations</a>. This tool will be replaced by
        a general-purpose reconciliation tool in the next version of
        MAT.</li>
      <li><b>New standalone document viewer and annotation tool</b>: You
        can now embed a <a href="standalone_viewer.html">standalone
          version</a> of the MAT document viewing component in your own
        Web application. This viewer can be enabled for hand annotation,
        and it also supports document comparison.</li>
      <li><b>New capabilities in MATReport</b>: Expanded support for
        annotation attributes, including the ability to generate
        per-label expanded report spreadsheets.</li>
      <li><b>Hand annotation now supports adding overlapping annotations</b>:
        This corrects an enormous deficiency in previous versions of
        MAT. While annotating, the overlapping annotations are also
        vertically stacked, ensuring that they're visible.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>No Cygwin support</h3>
    <p>Support for Cygwin has been removed, because Python in Cygwin
      does not support sqlite, and sqlite is required for the MAT
      workspaces in 2.0. Migrate to Windows native.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Python 2.6 or later required</h3>
    MAT 2.0 makes extensive use of JSON and sqlite, which are best
    supported in Python 2.6 or 2.7. It also relies on Python's "with"
    statement, which is supported first in 2.6.
    <h3>Task.xml schema has changed</h3>
    <p>Because MAT now explicitly defines the annotations and
      well-formedness conditions for attributes separately from its
      display information, the task.xml file has been reorganized. You
      can use the <a href="MATUpdateTaskXML.html">MATUpdateTaskXML</a>
      tool to update your task.xml file automatically.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The &lt;tags&gt; element has been replaced by the
        &lt;annotation_set_descriptors&gt; and
        &lt;annotation_display&gt; elements. These new elements are
        quite different than the old ones. If you're receiving MAT as a
        zip file distribution with tasks included, your tasks have been
        updated.</li>
      <li>Because the UI has been completely redesigned, the
        &lt;web_customization&gt; element no longer accepts the
        default_tag_window_position and default_tag_window_size
        attributes.</li>
      <li>The tagging_step attribute of &lt;step_implementations&gt; is
        no longer accepted (or needed).</li>
      <li>Because of changes in the implementation of workspaces, the
        tagprep operation has been replaced by the import operation, and
        the list of steps required for the tag operation is now only
        "tag".<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>All models must be rebuilt (new version of jCarafe)<br>
    </h3>
    <p>The version of jCarafe which is delivered with MAT 2.0 is
      0.9.8.5.b-06, which has a different model structure than the
      version delivered with 1.3. You must rebuild all your models,
      either using <a href="MATModelBuilder.html">MATModelBuilder</a>
      (in file mode) or the "modelbuild" operation of <a
        href="MATWorkspaceEngine.html">MATWorkspaceEngine</a> (in
      workspace mode).<br>
    </p>
    <h3>UI has been completely reorganized, with a new URL</h3>
    <p>The 1.3 UI used a desktop-in-a-browser metaphor, which raised a
      number of issues, including poor use of screen real estate. In
      2.0, we've completely reorganized the UI, and <a
        href="start_ui.html">changed the URL</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>mat_controller.sh is replaced by the --spawn_tabbed_terminal
      option of MATWeb</h3>
    <p>In previous releases, you really didn't have the option to pass
      any command-line options to the MATWeb server running under the
      tabbed terminal. As the command-line options to MATWeb expanded,
      and became more important, this turned out to be a bad idea. As a
      result, we've now reorganized the tabbed terminal startup so that
      it's part of MATWeb. The mat_controller.sh application is gone.
      The Windows mat_controller.bat script is still present, but it
      simply invokes MATWeb with the --spawn_tabbed_terminal option.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Workspaces have been completely reorganized</h3>
    <p>We have completely reorganized the internal structure of <a
        href="workspaces.html">workspaces</a> for 2.0. These new
      workspaces are more powerful and impose fewer requirements on the
      user. Your MAT 1.3 workspaces cannot be used with MAT 2.0 without
      modification. We've provided an <a href="MATUpdateWorkspace1To2.html">upgrade
















        tool</a> which will allow you to convert your MAT 1.3 workspaces
      to MAT 2.0. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The new workspaces feature many fewer folders; a SQLite database
      which manages the document state information; real transaction and
      file locking; document assignment, potentially to multiple
      annotators; extensive logging capabilities; and infrastructure for
      future capabilities like reconciliation and complex reconciliation
      workflows, prioritization queues, and segment-by-segment
      annotation.<br>
    </p>
    <p>As a result of this change, it's no longer possible to run an
      experiment against a workspace by pointing to, e.g., the
      "completed" folder. So as part of this change, there's now special
      support for running experiments against workspaces, both from <a
        href="MATWorkspaceEngine.html">MATWorkspaceEngine</a> and <a
        href="MATExperimentEngine.html">MATExperimentEngine</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Scorer output ranges have changed</h3>
    In version 1.3, recall, precision and f-measure were all scaled from
    0 to 100. In 2.0, they're scaled from 0 to 1.
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>CSV spreadsheet management in MATScore and MATExperimentEngine
      has changed</h3>
    <p><a href="MATScore.html">MATScore</a> and <a
        href="MATExperimentEngine.html">MATExperimentEngine</a> have
      long supported writing one of three CSV file formats (Excel
      formulas, OpenOffice formulas, and no formulas). In 2.0, you can
      now write multiple formats in the same run, and the name of each
      CSV file clearly indicates the formula type. As a result, the
      --no_csv_formulas and --oo_separator command-line options have
      been removed, and replaced with --csv_formula_output.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>MATScore --tag_span_details renamed</h3>
    <p>Because the scorer now provides mismatch details for all
      conditions, this flag has been renamed to
      --tag_output_mismatch_details.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>MATScore spreadsheet output has changed</h3>
    <p>Due to enhancements to the scorer, some of the columns in the
      output spreadsheets have been renamed or moved, and others have a
      slightly different interpretation. Full details <a
        href="score_output.html">here</a>. <br>
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>Command-line options to MATWorkspaceEngine have changed<br>
    </h3>
    <p>In previous releases, we deprecated, but retained, the "operate"
      operation in MATWorkspaceEngine. This operation has finally been
      removed in 2.0. If you had still been doing something like this:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>% <span style="font-weight: bold;">$MAT_PKG_HOME/bin/MATWorkspaceEngine mydirectory operate core modelbuild</span><br></pre>
    <p>you should now do this:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>% <span style="font-weight: bold;">$MAT_PKG_HOME/bin/MATWorkspaceEngine mydirectory modelbuild core</span><br></pre>
    <p>See the <a href="MATWorkspaceEngine.html">workspace
        documentation</a> for more details.<br>
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>Upgrading from version 1.2 to version 1.3</h2>
    <h3>Web server security has been improved</h3>
    We now provide a separate document on <a
      href="workspace_security.html">Web server security</a> as it
    pertains to workspace access. There are a number of new options to <a
      href="MATWeb.html">MATWeb</a> to support improved security. The
    most visible effect is that you can restrict access to workspaces
    from the MAT UI by using the --workspace_container_directory option
    when you start up the MAT Web server.<br>
    <h3>Attribute to control right-to-left text display has moved</h3>
    <p>In version 1.2, the text_right_to_left attribute lived on the
      workflow element in task.xml; we anticipated that different
      workflows might be used for different languages within the same
      task. Since then, we've realized that the task is going to be the
      appropriate level of encapsulation for language differences for
      the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the current implementation of
      right-to-left encoding did not work appropriately with workspaces.
      Accordingly, we've moved this attribute to the web_customization
      element, and it is now global to tasks.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Corpus size iteration has changed<br>
    </h3>
    <p>The experiment engine has now been extended with general-purpose
      iterators for sets of values and for value increments. So it's now
      possible, for instance, to vary the number of model iterations
      from 20 to 100 by increments of 10 without having to write a
      separate model set specification for each possible value. These
      iterators can be combined, in which case you'll get the
      cross-product of the possible value settings, or you can define
      your own iterators to get more sophisticated behavior (e.g.,
      iterating over pairs of attribue-value sets). For the user, this
      means that a couple of attributes have been removed from the
      experiment engine, and a new set of elements and attributes has
      been added.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In version 1.2, all you could iterate on was corpus size. The
      mechanism for this iteration has now changed. In version 1.2, this
      is what you'd do:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>  [...]<br>  &lt;model_sets dir="model_sets"&gt;<br>    <span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;build_settings training_increment="4" </span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">                    truncate_to_increment="yes"/&gt;</span><br>    &lt;model_set name="test"&gt;<br>      &lt;training_corpus corpus="test" partition="train"/&gt;<br>    &lt;/model_set&gt;<br>  &lt;/model_sets&gt;<br>  [...]<br></pre>
    <p>In version 1.3, it looks like this instead:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>  [...]<br>  &lt;model_sets dir="model_sets"&gt;<br>    <span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;corpus_settings&gt;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">      &lt;iterator type="corpus_size" increment="4"/&gt;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">    &lt;/corpus_settings&gt;</span><br>    &lt;model_set name="test"&gt;<br>      &lt;training_corpus corpus="test" partition="train"/&gt;<br>    &lt;/model_set&gt;<br>  &lt;/model_sets&gt;<br>  [...]<br></pre>
    <p>You can see that the size processing has been removed from the
      &lt;build_settings&gt; and added to a new &lt;corpus_settings&gt;
      element, which contains an instance of the new &lt;iterator&gt;
      element to specify the type of the iteration. See the <a
        href="experiment_xml.html">documentation</a> and <a
        href="experiment_xml_use_cases.html">examples</a> for the
      experiment engine for more details. Note that in version 1.2, you
      had to specify explicitly that the iteration ends on an increment
      exactly; in 1.3 this is the default, and to force the final corpus
      size to be used, you'll need the force_last attribute:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>  [...]<br>  &lt;model_sets dir="model_sets"&gt;<br>    <span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;corpus_settings&gt;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">      &lt;iterator type="corpus_size" increment="4" force_last="yes"/&gt;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">    &lt;/corpus_settings&gt;</span><br>    &lt;model_set name="test"&gt;<br>      &lt;training_corpus corpus="test" partition="train"/&gt;<br>    &lt;/model_set&gt;<br>  &lt;/model_sets&gt;<br>  [...]</pre>
    <h3>Experiment spreadsheet columns have been expanded</h3>
    <p>The experiment engine output spreadsheets have been slightly
      expanded to include information about the run and model "families"
      in addition to the actual run and model. This change follows from
      the introduction of general iterators described above. See the
      documentation on <a href="MATExperimentEngine.html">MATExperimentEngine</a>
      for details.</p>
    <h3>Experiment directory structure has changed</h3>
    <p>In order to support the iterators in the experiment engine, we've
      reorganized the structure of the experiment directory somewhat.
      See the documentation on <a href="MATExperimentEngine.html">MATExperimentEngine</a>
      for details.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Upgrading from version 1.1 to version 1.2</h2>
    <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>New native Windows port</h3>
    <p>It is now possible to run MAT in Windows without Cygwin
      installed.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Single distribution bundle for all platforms</h3>
    <p>Unlike previous versions, there is a single distribution bundle
      for MAT 1.2 for all supported platforms. For compatibility with
      Windows, this bundle is now a zip file.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>New tabbed terminal for Windows</h3>
    <p>If you use mat_controller.sh or mat_controller.bat under Windows,
      you'll find that there's a new tabbed terminal tool we're using,
      which has the advantage of not requiring Cygwin.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>New version of Terminator.app for MacOS X 10.6</h3>
    <p>If you're using mat_controller.sh under MacOS X, and you intend
      to install 10.6, note that the previous version of Terminator.app,
      which supports the tabbed terminal behavior in mat_controller.sh,
      will not work in 10.6; you must install the newer version provided
      with MAT 1.2.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Tokenizer has changed</h3>
    <p>In version 1.2, the original OCaml tokenizer and Carafe
      trainer/tagger have been replaced by the Java reimplementations.
      There are a number of important changes that are required as a
      result. Among other things, the Java tokenizer produces slightly
      different token boundaries than the original OCaml tokenizer. This
      is problematic because the entire basis of most annotation
      systems, including MAT, is the subdivision into words (tokens). In
      order to have optimal performance, the tokenization of documents
      which are to be automatically tagged should match the tokenization
      of the documents which were used to create the tagger model. This
      means that in order to migrate from version 1.1 to version 1.2,
      among other things, you must retokenize your documents and update
      any references to the OCaml tokenizer.<br>
    </p>
    <p>First, to retokenize your documents, we've provided the new <a
        href="MATRetokenize.html">MATRetokenize</a> utility. Please back
      up your data before you run this utility.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Next, if you refer to a tokenization step implementation in your
      <a href="task_xml.html">task.xml</a> file, you must change all
      occurrences of MAT.PluginMgr.CarafeTokenizationStep to
      MAT.JavaCarafe.CarafeTokenizationStep. You may also need to
      specify the heap_size attribute on the relevant tokenization
      &lt;step&gt; in any workflow,&nbsp; if it turns out that the
      default Java heap size isn't large enough for your purposes (this
      attribute can also be specified on the command line; see the <a
        href="carafe_engine.html">Carafe engine</a> documentation).<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Trainer/tagger has changed</h3>
    <p>In version 1.2, the original OCaml tokenizer and Carafe
      trainer/tagger have been replaced by the Java reimplementations.
      There are a number of important changes that are required as a
      result. Among other things, the model format for the Java engine
      is completely different than the model format for the original
      OCaml tokenizer. This means that you must rebuild all your models,
      and update any references to the OCaml trainer/tagger.<br>
    </p>
    <p>First, retokenize your documents using MATRetokenize, as
      described above, and update your tokenization steps.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Next, update your tagger and trainer settings in task.xml
      according to the documentation provided for the <a
        href="carafe_engine.html">Carafe engine</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Next, if you refer to a tagging step in your <a
        href="task_xml.html">task.xml</a> file, you must change all
      occurrences of MAT.PluginMgr.CarafeTagStep to
      MAT.JavaCarafe.CarafeTagStep. You may also need to specify the
      heap_size attribute on the relevant tag &lt;step&gt; in any
      workflow,&nbsp; if it turns out that the default Java heap size
      isn't large enough for your purposes (this attribute can also be
      specified on the command line; see the <a
        href="carafe_engine.html">Carafe engine</a> documentation).
      Similarly, if you have a &lt;model_build_settings&gt; entry, you
      must change all occurrences of
      MAT.CarafeModelBuilder.CarafeModelBuilder to
      MAT.JavaCarafe.CarafeModelBuilder, and possibly specify the
      heap_size attribute as well. (Note below that you must also change
      the syntax of &lt;model_build_settings&gt;.)<br>
    </p>
    <p>Note that for the tagger, the prior_adjst attribute has been
      renamed to prior_adjust. For the trainer, the engine attribute has
      been eliminated, and the feature_set attribute as well; there's
      now a new feature_spec attribute which refers to a file in which
      you can describe your feature set, if you don't want to use the
      default feature set. Also, the psa_iterations flag has been
      removed, due to more numerous&nbsp; options in the Carafe trainer;<br>
    </p>
    <pre>psa_iterations="6"<br></pre>
    <p>becomes<br>
    </p>
    <pre>training_method="psa" max_iterations="6"<br></pre>
    <p> Because PSA no longer requires random segments, the
      no_random_psa_segments flag has been removed.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Finally, use the same tools as before to build your models:
      either MATModelBuild in file mode, or the modelbuild operation in
      workspace mode.</p>
    <h3>Internals of experiment directories have changed</h3>
    <p>In order to support a more flexible way of specifying partitions
      in experiments, the way the configuration of experiments is cached
      has changed in version 1.2. What this means is that you will not
      be able to invoke MATExperimentEngine on experiment directories
      created using version 1.1 to regenerate the experiment scores.</p>
    <h3>Experiment XML files have changed</h3>
    <p>In order to support a more flexible way of specifying partitions
      in experiments, we've changed the way partitions are specified in
      the experiment XML files. We compare the relevant files below:<br>
    </p>
    <p>Version 1.1:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;experiment task='Named Entity'&gt;<br>  &lt;corpora dir="corpora"&gt;<br>    &lt;partition split_fraction=".2" ctype="split"/&gt;<br>    &lt;corpus name="test"&gt;<br>      &lt;pattern&gt;*.json&lt;/pattern&gt;<br>    &lt;/corpus&gt;<br>  &lt;/corpora&gt;<br>  &lt;model_sets dir="model_sets"&gt;<br>    &lt;model_set name="test" corpus="test"/&gt;<br>  &lt;/model_sets&gt;<br>  &lt;runs dir="runs"&gt;<br>    &lt;run_settings&gt;<br>      &lt;args steps="zone,tokenize,tag" workflow="Demo"/&gt;<br>    &lt;/run_settings&gt;<br>    &lt;run name="test" model="test" corpus="test"/&gt;<br>  &lt;/runs&gt;<br>&lt;/experiment&gt;</pre>
    <p>Version 1.2:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;experiment task='Named Entity'&gt;<br>  &lt;corpora dir="corpora"&gt;<br>    &lt;partition name="train" fraction=".8"/&gt;<br>    &lt;partition name="test" fraction=".2"/&gt;<br>    &lt;corpus name="test"&gt;<br>      &lt;pattern&gt;*.json&lt;/pattern&gt;<br>    &lt;/corpus&gt;<br>  &lt;/corpora&gt;<br>  &lt;model_sets dir="model_sets"&gt;<br>    &lt;model_set name="test"&gt;<br>      &lt;training_corpus corpus="test" partition="train"/&gt;<br>    &lt;/model_set&gt;<br>  &lt;/model_sets&gt;<br>  &lt;runs dir="runs"&gt;<br>    &lt;run_settings&gt;<br>      &lt;args steps="zone,tokenize,tag" workflow="Demo"/&gt;<br>    &lt;/run_settings&gt;<br>    &lt;run name="test" model="test"&gt;<br>      &lt;test_corpus corpus="test" partition="test"/&gt;<br>    &lt;/run&gt;<br>  &lt;/runs&gt;<br>&lt;/experiment&gt;<br></pre>
    <p>Note the following changes:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The &lt;partition&gt; element now explicitly specifies named
        partitions and their fractions. You are no longer restricted to
        designating a corpus exclusively as test, exclusively as train,
        or as a single split.</li>
      <li>The remainder of the attributes of the &lt;partition&gt;
        element have been moved to a new &lt;size&gt; element (not
        exemplified here).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Multiple corpora, and partitions, can be associated with a
        single &lt;model_set&gt; or &lt;run&gt;.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>The "corpus" attributes of the &lt;model_set&gt; and
        &lt;run&gt; arguments are no longer recognized. The
        &lt;training_corpus&gt; and &lt;test_corpus&gt; child elements
        replace them.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Settings in task.xml have changed</h3>
    <p>In order to clarify how task settings are handled in MAT, a
      number of changes have been made to the <a href="task_xml.html">task.xml</a>
      file syntax.<br>
    </p>
    <p>First, the &lt;step&gt; element of &lt;step_implementations&gt;
      no longer accepts arbitrary attributes. If you made use of this
      feature to pass settings to the initialization methods of workflow
      steps, you must now use the &lt;create_settings&gt; child element.
      We doubt that anyone has made use of this feature.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Second, the &lt;step&gt; element of &lt;workflow&gt; no longer
      accepts arbitrary attributes. If you make use of this feature to
      pass settings to workflow steps, you must now use the
      &lt;create_settings&gt;, &lt;ui_settings&gt;, or
      &lt;run_settings&gt; child elements. The most likely situation
      where this might arise is in passing defaults to the run methods
      of steps. For instance, if you used this feature to increase the
      Java heap size for Java Carafe, your task.xml file would have to
      be revised as follows.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Version 1.1:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>  ...<br>  &lt;workflows&gt;<br>    &lt;workflow name="Demo" hand_annotation_available_at_end="yes"&gt;<br>      &lt;step name="zone"/&gt;<br>      &lt;step name="tokenize"/&gt;<br>      &lt;step name="tag" heap_size="2G"/&gt;<br>    &lt;/workflow&gt;<br>    ...<br>  &lt;/workflows&gt;<br>  ...<br></pre>
    <p>Version 1.2:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>  ...<br>  &lt;workflows&gt;<br>    &lt;workflow name="Demo" hand_annotation_available_at_end="yes"&gt;<br>      &lt;step name="zone"/&gt;<br>      &lt;step name="tokenize"/&gt;<br>      &lt;step name="tag"&gt;<br>        &lt;run_settings heap_size="2G"/&gt;<br>      &lt;/step&gt;<br>    &lt;/workflow&gt;<br>    ...<br>  &lt;/workflows&gt;<br>  ...<br></pre>
    <p>Second, the way settings are specified for model configurations
      has changed. The name and class for the configuration are now
      separated from the settings which are passed to the model builder,
      as follows.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Version 1.1:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>  ...<br>  &lt;model_build_settings class="MAT.JavaCarafe.CarafeModelBuilder"<br>                        training_method="psa" max_iterations="6"/&gt;<br>  &lt;/model_build_settings&gt;<br>  ...<br></pre>
    <p>Version 1.2:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>  ...<br>  &lt;model_config class="MAT.JavaCarafe.CarafeModelBuilder"&gt;<br>    &lt;build_settings training_method="psa" max_iterations="6"/&gt;<br>  &lt;/model_config&gt;<br>  ...<br></pre>
    <p>Finally, the &lt;workflow&gt; element no longer accepts arbitrary
      settings; these settings must be passed using the
      &lt;ui_settings&gt; child element. No task appears to use this
      option yet, so this shouldn't affect anyone.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Upgrading from version 1.0 to version 1.1</h2>
    <h3>Internals of experiment directories have changed</h3>
    <p>In order to support a more flexible way of invoking the MAT
      engine in experiments, the way the configuration of experiments is
      cached has changed in version 1.1. What this means is that you
      will not be able to invoke MATExperimentEngine on experiment
      directories created using version 1.0 to regenerate the experiment
      scores.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Experiment XML files have changed</h3>
    <p>In order to support a more flexible way of invoking the MAT
      engine in experiments, we've changed the way corpus preprocessing
      and test run processing are specified. In version 1.0, the MAT
      engine was called as a command-line tool, and the options were
      specified as a command line; in version 1.1, the options are
      specified as XML attribute-value pairs. We compare the relevant
      experiment XML blocks below:<br>
    </p>
    <p>Version 1.0:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>  &lt;corpora dir="corpora"&gt;<br>    &lt;prep&gt;--input_file_type xml-inline --workflow Align --steps 'zone,tokenize,align'&lt;/prep&gt;<br>    [...]<br>  &lt;/corpora&gt;<br><br>  &lt;runs dir="runs"&gt;<br>    &lt;run_settings&gt;<br>      &lt;args&gt;--steps zone,tokenize,tag --workflow Demo&lt;/args&gt;<br>    &lt;/run_settings&gt;<br>    [...]<br>  &lt;/runs&gt;<br></pre>
    <p>Version 1.1:</p>
    <pre>  &lt;corpora dir="corpora"&gt;<br>    &lt;prep input_file_type="xml-inline" workflow="Align" steps="zone,tokenize,align"/&gt;<br>    [...]<br>  &lt;/corpora&gt;<br><br>  &lt;runs dir="runs"&gt;<br>    &lt;run_settings&gt;<br>      &lt;args steps="zone,tokenize,tag" workflow="Demo"/&gt;<br>    &lt;/run_settings&gt;<br>    [...]<br>  &lt;/runs&gt;<br></pre>
    <h3>New training engine configuration in task.xml</h3>
    <p>Version 1.1 adds the ability to define different training
      engines. Because of this change, if you've defined your own task
      and you specified model build settings in your task.xml file, you
      must add a class attribute to the model_build_settings element.
      This attribute is not optional, and there is no default. If you're
      using the default Carafe engine, the value you should use for this
      attribute is MAT.CarafeModelBuilder.CarafeModelBuilder, as in the
      following example:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>  &lt;model_build_settings class="MAT.CarafeModelBuilder.CarafeModelBuilder" <br>                        engine="anonTrain.native" feature_set="ANON-1"<br>                        psa_iterations="6"/&gt;</pre>
    <h3>New folder in workspaces</h3>
    <p>Version 1.1 adds the ability to import MAT JSON documents into
      your workspaces which haven't yet been processed (as well as other
      annotation formats, like XML inline). Because of this change, if
      you have a workspace, you must add a directory to it. This
      directory is expected by the MAT workspace engine. For each
      workspace directory, do this:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>% mkdir &lt;workspace_dir&gt;/folders/rich_incoming<br></pre>
    <h3>New command line option restriction for MATModelBuilder</h3>
    <p>In version 1.1, it's possible to have multiple model build
      configurations in your task.xml file. In order to ensure that the
      correct configuration adds the appropriate command line options to
      the MATModelBuilder executable, it was necessary to introduce a
      new restriction on the&nbsp; --task option for MATModelBuilder: if
      it appears, it must now be the first command-line option. In other
      words, the following will now raise an error:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>% <span style="font-weight: bold;">$MAT_PKG_HOME/bin/MATModelBuilder \</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">--input_files '/path/to/my/docs/1[0-9][0-9].json' \</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">--input_dir /path/to/my/other/docs </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">--task "Named Entity" </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">\</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">--lexicon_dir /path/to/my/lexicon/ --save_as_default_model</span></pre>
    <h3>Change to how the default model is specified in task.xml</h3>
    <p>In version 1.0, the default model was defined within the model
      build settings. In version 1.1, because of the presence of
      multiple model bulid configurations, we've separated the
      specification of the default model in task.xml.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Version 1.0:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>  &lt;model_build_settings engine="anonTrain.native" feature_set="ANON-1"<br>                        psa_iterations="6" default_model="default_model"/&gt;</pre>
    <p>Version 1.1:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>  &lt;model_build_settings class="MAT.CarafeModelBuilder.CarafeModelBuilder" <br>                        engine="anonTrain.native" feature_set="ANON-1"<br>                        psa_iterations="6"/&gt;<br>  &lt;default_model&gt;default_model&lt;/default_model&gt;<br></pre>
