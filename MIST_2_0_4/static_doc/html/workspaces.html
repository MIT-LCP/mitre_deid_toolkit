    <h1>Using workspaces</h1>
    <p>Workspaces provide a guided, structured way of managing and
      processing your documents. Workspace mode offers a number of
      advantages over working with documents manually in file mode, but
      it is difficult to change modes once you've begun, so <a
        href="files_and_workspaces.html">make sure</a> that this is what
      you want. Workspace mode is provided by MATWorkspaceEngine on the
      command line, and via "File -&gt; Open workspace..." in the Web
      UI. <br>
    </p>
    <p>To process documents in a workspace, you must import those
      documents into the workspace. The workspace maintains a physical
      copy of that document, and also keeps track of information about
      the document (e.g., how far it's been processed) in a separate
      database inside the workspace. While workspaces are simply
      directories, it's important that you, as the user, not modify
      these directories by hand (i.e., no adding, removing, or editing
      files) - you should only interact with the workspace via the <a
        href="ui_workspaces.html">MAT UI</a> or the <a
        href="MATWorkspaceEngine.html">workspace engine</a>. You should
      also never use <a href="MATEngine.html">MATEngine</a> or <a
        href="MATModelBuilder.html">MATModelBuilder</a> to save files or
      models into workspaces.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Each workspace has at least one workspace user. This is not a
      security feature, and no security (e.g., a password) is associated
      with it. The users are there merely to partition and track the
      hand annotation that's performed on the document. If you set up
      your own workspace, you can use whatever name you choose; if your
      <a href="how_to_use.html">task maintainer</a> set up your
      workspace as a server on a separate machine, she'll tell you what
      username to use.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Using_the_workspace"></a>Using the workspace<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Let's see how you can use workspaces. <a href="tutorial_6.html">Tutorial














        6</a> presents examples of most of the steps below, and more
      examples can be found in the documentation for <a
        href="MATWorkspaceEngine.html">MATWorkspaceEngine</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Step 1: create the workspace<br>
    </h3>
    <p>First, you create the workspace. The workspace must have an
      assigned task, which you specify when you create it. Creating the
      workspace creates the directory, the folder subdirectories, a
      place to store the models, and some administrative information.<br>
    </p>
    <p>You must also specify an initial user when you create the
      workspace. Unlike file mode, all annotation in workspaces is
      attributed to one or more named annotators.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Workspace creation is currently only available on the command
      line.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2: import documents</h3>
    <p>Next, you import documents into the workspace. At the moment, the
      workspace has three predefined folders, "core", "export" and
      "reconciliation". Only "core" is currently used. Your task may
      also define additional folders, which you might import documents
      into, but typically, you'll import documents into the "core"
      folder.<br>
    </p>
    <p> When a document is imported, it is assigned a unique basename,
      which is usually the basename of the path of the imported file
      (i.e., the final path component). All versions of this file in the
      various workspace folders have the identical basename. If you
      assign a document to a particular annotator, its basename will be
      suffixed with the name of the assigned annotator; if you assign
      the document to multiple annotators, each annotator will have his
      or her own copy.<br>
    </p>
    <p>You can import documents as many times as you like, and at any
      point while you work with your workspace. For instance, you can
      import some documents, hand annotate them, and then build a model,
      and then import more raw documents to autotag. <br>
    </p>
    <p>File import is currently only available on the command line.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3: perform operations on documents</h3>
    <p>The vast majority of your time in the workspace will be spent
      interacting with your documents. Each folder has predefined
      operations which you can perform on documents in the folder. The
      operations you can perform on folders, as well as the operations
      you can perform on the workspace itself, are described <a
        href="workspace_ref.html#Workspace_operations">here</a>. (As we
      said earlier, at the moment, only the "core" folder is being
      used.)<br>
    </p>
    <p>On the command line, these operations are applied by default to
      all the files in the folder, and optional to a specified subset.
      In the UI, on the other hand, these operations are only available
      on a file-by-file basis. We haven't yet tackled managing the more
      time-consuming folder-level operations in the UI.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>A typical interaction</h3>
    <p>Because interacting with the workspace means switching between
      longer-duration batch operations (e.g., model building) and
      quicker file-level operations, (e.g., hand tagging), the user will
      end up moving back and forth between the UI and the terminal. This
      is currently unavoidable. Here's what a typical interaction might
      look like.<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Command line: Create a workspace<br>
      </li>
      <li>Command line: Import a batch of documents<br>
      </li>
      <li>UI: Hand annotate some documents<br>
      </li>
      <li>Command line: Build a model and autotag the raw documents you
        haven't hand annotated<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Step 4 can be repeated with newly imported documents, so you can
      iteratively expand the model and your supply of hand-corrected
      documents.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Workspace_logging"></a>Workspace logging</h2>
    <p>You can enable logging in your workspace. The logger will capture
      all the workspace operations, and also collect all the
      interactions that users have with workspaces in the <a
        href="ui_workspaces.html">workspace UI</a>. This UI logging is
      completely separate from the <a
        href="ui_settings.html#The_logging_button">global UI logger</a>.
      The user has no control over whether workspace logging happens;
      it's controlled entirely from the command line. See <a
        href="workspace_ref.html#Logging">here</a> for more details.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Workspace_security"></a>Workspace security<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Unlike file mode, workspace mode is <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">stateful</span> from the point of view of the UI. It is
      the server, rather than the client, which loads and saves the
      files. However, we don't want just anybody to be able to cause the
      server to perform these stateful operations, so the <a
        href="MATWeb.html">MAT web server</a> implements <a
        href="workspace_security.html">some security mechanisms</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Note, however, that the MAT workspace functionality is <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">not an enterprise-secure
        implementation, and will never be one</span>. It does not use
      SSL; it does not perform any sort of user authentication beyond
      the workspace key; it does not provide any security logging or
      traceability; and it does not currently implement transactions.
      You should assume that anyone who has access to your network can
      see your workspace traffic, and overwrite your data. </p>
    <p>Note that workspace users play no role in workspace security.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Troubleshooting"></a> Troubleshooting</h2>
    <h3>Failed import</h3>
    <p>You may realize, once you've completed an import operation, that
      you didn't import the basenames the way you'd wanted; perhaps
      you'd intended to strip a suffix, or you assigned them to the
      wrong workspace user. If you need to undo your import, see <a
        href="workspace_ref.html#Failed_import">here</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Locked files</h3>
    <p>Documents in workspaces can only be edited by one user at a time.
      When you're editing a document, and you close the window, the
      workspace makes that document available to other annotators if
      appropriate. Sometimes, the "lock" the workspace applies while
      you're editing doesn't get freed. If the UI tells you that a
      document is locked by someone other than you, and you're supposed
      to be editing it, see <a href="workspace_ref.html#Locked_files">here</a>.</p>
    <h3>Error "workspace is currently unavailable (processing another
      request)"</h3>
    <p>If you get this error message, and you're absolutely certain that
      no one else is working on the workspace, something horrible has
      happened, and a previous operation has failed in such a way that
      the entire workspace is locked. More on how to deal with this <a
        href="workspace_ref.html#Workspace_locking">here</a>.<br>
