    <p>This toolkit is known to run on Windows 7. It has run in the past
      on Windows XP, but we no longer have access to Windows XP for
      testing. We have no access to Windows Vista, and don't expect to.
      We do not have access to Windows 8.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This toolkit depends on a number of external tools which must be
      installed before you install MAT. For the Windows version, they
      are:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Python, version 2.6 or later. Most of our development is
        currently on 2.7. 3.x is known not to work.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Java, version 1.6.0_04 or later.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="Conventions"></a>Conventions</h2>
    <p>MAT is primarily a Unix-based tool, so the documentation is
      written mostly with reference to Unix. As a result, you should
      first familiarize yourself with the <a
        href="unix_req_etc.html#Conventions">Unix conventions</a>, and
      make sure you know the DOS CMD equivalents of basic Unix
      operations like pwd, cd, etc. We'll assume throughout that you've
      set your MAT_PKG_HOME cmd shell variable to the directory src/MAT
      inside the unpacked zip file. </p>
    <p>The documentation assumes you've added Python to your Windows
      path.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">MAT may be installed in
        directories whose paths contain spaces</span>. If you do this,
      you'll likely have to wrap double-quotes around any references to
      MAT_PKG_HOME or subdirectories thereof:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">cd "%MAT_PKG_HOME%"</span><br>&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">dir "%CD%"</span><br></pre>
    <p>If you don't do this, you'll likely encounter bizarre behavior
      due to the path being expanded and split into command-line tokens
      according to the whitespace in the path.<br>
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2><a name="Installation"></a>Installation</h2>
    <p>First, ensure that you have Java installed. You'll need version
      1.6.0_04 or later. The installer looks for any version of Java
      found in C:\Program Files\Java. The installer will probe all the
      Java versions and choose the newest one that meets the system
      requirements. If you don't have Java, you can get it from Sun.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Next, install Python. You don't need any of Mark Hammond's Python
      win32 extensions. You may want to add Python to your Windows path.
      None of the instructions in this documentation should require
      that, but if you do find an instruction to run python.exe, use the
      full executable path for Python if you haven't added it to your
      path..<br>
    </p>
    <p>Next, open a Windows cmd shell, e.g., via Start -&gt; Run -&gt;
      cmd. We recommend that you ensure that the output history is
      longer than the default 50 lines; click left on the leftmost icon
      in the top window bar in the "cmd" window, select Properties,
      select the Layout tab, and change "Height" under "Screen Buffer
      Size" to, say, 500. </p>
    <p>Next, open the unzipped directory containing this distribution in
      your file viewer (e.g., navigating from "My Computer"). In the top
      directory of the distribution, you should see a file "install.py".
      In your cmd shell window, type "python" (if you've added Python to
      your Windows path), or the full path to the executable (probably
      "C:\Python27\python.exe"), and then a space, and then drag the
      "install.py" file to the cmd shell window. Switch to the cmd shell
      and press &lt;return&gt;. This will run the MAT installer.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The output of the installer is fairly verbose. If it does not
      print out "Done" at the end, it hasn't completed appropriately.<br>
    </p>
    <p>When the installation is complete, your <a
        href="runtime_env.html">runtime environment</a> will be
      configured for you. The installed directory is <b>not relocatable</b>;
      you must rerun the installer if you move the installation.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Upgrading_dependencies_or_moving_the"></a>Upgrading
      dependencies or moving the installation</h2>
    <p>If you want MAT to use a new version of Java or Python because
      the Java or Python on your machine has been upgraded and the old
      version is no longer present, just rerun the installer. The
      installer will find the updated versions and reconfigure your
      tools.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If you want to move the MAT installation from one location to
      another on the same machine, just move the toplevel MAT directory
      - it's completely self-contained. If you want to move the MAT
      installation to another machine, the safest thing to do is
      reinstall on that new machine.</p>
