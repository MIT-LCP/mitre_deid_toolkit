    <h1>Version history</h1>
    <h2>2.0.4</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed an ordering bug MAT-JSON deserialization in Java,
        Javascript and Python where annotations which both have
        annotation-valued attributes and are values of other
        annotation-valued attributes might not have their
        non-annotation-valued attributes decoded in time to satisfy the
        restrictions of the attribute they're a value of.</li>
      <li>Updated build script to update version number in JAR manifest.</li>
      <li>Fixed a couple small bugs in MATAnnotationInfoToJSON.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where the incorrect content type was being
        reported to the browser on UI document save, causing an
        incorrect file extension to be added in Safari.</li>
      <li>Fixed an suboptimal behavior where XML inline output was
        producing extraneous (but harmless) toplevel XML tags to ensure
        XML well-formedness.</li>
      <li>Expanded the options available in the UI for the xml-inline
        reader, and improved the associated documentation.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2.0.3</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a bug in the Java core library where annotation IDs were
        being processed incorrectly.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2.0.2</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a bug where right-to-left languages were incorrectly
        justified.</li>
      <li>Compensated for a bug in YUI which caused buttons to be
        attached at unreliable times, making it impossible to center the
        editor popups vertically.</li>
      <li>Fixed a small bug in the pairer where the similarity
        comparison was returning incorrect values in one specific case.</li>
      <li>Removed duplicate definitions of inChooseMode() in the
        standalone viewer.</li>
      <li>Compensated for a z-index bug in YUI which causes annotation
        menu popups to appear behind annotation editor popups in some
        cases, and for newer popups to appear behind older ones.</li>
      <li>Compensated for a series of YUI bugs which caused menu
        scrolling to behave strangely in annotation menu popups which
        exceeded the height of the viewport.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where menu scrolling in long annotation menu
        popups was too slow.</li>
      <li>Disabled the the "Unset" button in annotation editors for
        attributes in choose mode, to avoid mischief.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where pressing the close button on a tab while the
        user is being asked whether to reload or close would cause an
        error.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where it was possible to close tabs while waiting
        for a step result from the Web server.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Made all question dialogs modal.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in keypress handling where modern browsers were no
        longer sending what we previously expected for
        &lt;Enter&gt;/&lt;Return&gt;. Also changed &lt;Tab&gt; to "-"
        for deleting annotations because of cross-browser
        incompatibility issues.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug in the UI where annotations without any display
        entry could be selected by clicking.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where some of the gestures in annotation context
        menus in annotation editors were not bound correctly.</li>
      <li>Fixed a number of bugs relating to how assigned files are
        processed from the UI.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where setting MAT_PKG_HOME as an environment
        variable possibly caused MAT to use the wrong value internally.</li>
      <li>It is no longer possible to open the same file more than once
        in the workspace UI. Previously, it was possible, but the older
        buffers couldn't be saved or operated on.</li>

        errors from the backend was not draggable.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug in the standalone viewer where overlapping
        annotations weren't being stacked on initial display when hand
        annotation was enabled.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where tokenized documents containing annotations
        whose indices aren't aligned with the tokens caused a failure in
        collecting corpus statistics during model building.</li>
      <li>Added version information to Java JAR manifest.</li>
      <li>Fixed a small bug in UI autotagging involving matching a
        pattern which doesn't fall on token boundaries.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug with error handling in toolchain execution in
        workspaces.<br>
      </li>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a typo bug in the tagging service.</li>
      <li>Updated some documentation as a result of user feedback.</li>
      <li>Added the ability to add last tag in the UI, with a consistent
        keyboard accelerator.<br>
      </li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1.2RC6</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a bug in the scorer, where the task was not being used
        as a fallback source of tag label metadata.</li>
      <li>Modified MATScore to allow the user to provide lists of
        content annotations and token annotations directly, in case
        neither task nor tag label metadata is available.</li>

    <h2>1.2RC1</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The MAT UI now supports cascaded annotation menus, via the
        &lt;tag_group&gt; element in the task.xml file.</li>
      <li>The task.xml file now provides a means to control text
        direction for individual workflows, using the text_right_to_left
        attribute.</li>
      <li>The task.xml file syntax has been modified to clarify how
        attributes are handled by MAT. For advanced users, this
        necessitates a number of changes in the task.xml file (see the <a

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a bug where the scorer was breaking if files had no tags
        to score.</li>
      <li>It is now possible to use workspace operations directly on the
        command-line, without the "operate" operation.</li>
      <li>Replaced the OCaml tokenizer and Carafe tagger with the Java
        reimplementation. This necessitates a number of changes,
        including retokenizing your documents and rebuilding your models
        (see the <a
href="../../../../../branches/version_1_2_pre1_jcarafe_branch/MAT/web/htdocs/doc/html/upgrade_notes.html">upgrade




























































          notes</a>).</li>

        step are now appropriately cross-referenced in the help string.</li>
      <li>Workspace operations which don't affect any pathnames now
        raise an error.</li>
      <li>The system now appears to work in Python 2.6 and in MacOS X
        10.6.</li>
      <li>The experiment engine XML file now allows you to define
        bindings for commonly repeated values, and also supports
        explicitly referring to the experiment directory and pattern
        directory.</li>
      <li>The system now works in native Windows, without Cygwin.</li>
      <li>The system is now distributed in a single zip file for all
        platforms.</li>
      <li>The MAT UI has been improved to support hand annotation
        without tokens (although this is not recommended).<br>
      </li>
      <li>MacOS X no longer requires a special installation of Python,
        even though select.poll is still missing on that platform.</li>
      <li>Bug 24205: due to a bug in the experiment engine, non-default
        model configurations weren't being handled correctly. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bugs 15815, 19669: Make sure that the whole system does the
        right thing with spaces in filenames. Fixed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1.2pre1</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Extended and modified how corpora are specified in experiment
        XML, introducing considerably greater flexibility. It's now
        possible to specify n-way corpus splits, and group them
        arbitrarily in training and test runs.</li>

      <li>Fixed a bug in workspace locking.</li>
      <li>Minor documentation updates.<br>

    <ul>
      <li>Enabled confidence interval reporting. Added reporting of
        standard deviation.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added general workspace locking for operations, importing and
        removing basenames, opening a workspace file in the UI, and
        listing the contents of the workspace folders.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Initial support for Python 2.6.</li>
      <li>Upgraded to CherryPy 3.1.2.<br>

        documentation on MATExperimentEngine to describe how to prepare
        corpora with XML documents.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added support for multiple model build settings in task.xml.</li>
      <li>Added PluginMgr.AlignStep to the core to support alignment of
        externally-generated content tags with token boundaries.</li>
      <li>Converted calls to MATEngine command-line tool in the
        experiment engine to invocations of the MATEngine object.</li>
      <li>Expanded Java service API to cover checking for the existence
        of a workspace, listing the contents of a workspace folder, and
        opening a workspace file.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Bug 24020: due to a bug in the demo infrastructure, it was not
        possible to reprocess a document reliably. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 23988: proxies for multiple steps in task.xml weren't
        doing the right thing when the proxy set didn't exactly match
        between proxies. You shouldn't do this, and the UI still
        exhibits some unusual behavior, but it's fixed in the engine.</li>
      <li>Bug 21112: the experiment engine insisted on converting test
        documents to raw form before processing for the test run phase.
        It's now possible to specify other default preprocessing (e.g.,
        just undo tagging).</li>
      <li>Bug 20835: global maintenance of annotation type objects was
        not thread-safe. Fixed by making annotation type objects local
        to a document.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1.1pre1</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added XML reader and writer to MATEngine, MATModelBuilder,
        MATScore, UI.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added ability to define arbitrary readers and writers.</li>

      <li>Enhanced scorer to provide file-level count data to support
        computing confidence intervals (not enabled yet).</li>
      <li>Enhanced load and save in workspace mode in UI by adding the
        document basename to the Web service result.</li>
      <li>Added the "rich, incoming"&nbsp; folder to the core workspace,
        for importing files which are in rich format but not yet
        prepared for hand tagging.</li>
      <li>Enabled rich document readers to infer the processing state of
        documents which lack the appropriate metadata.</li>
      <li>Added "remove" operation to MATWorkspaceEngine.</li>
      <li>Fixed a subtle bug where tagging engines which fail on startup
        were not notifying the UI client properly about the failure.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1.0</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed an obscure bug where MAT JSON documents which share the
        same annotation label but have different attribute orders were
        being digested inconsistently.</li>
      <li>Fixed a small bug in MATWeb which prevented logs from rotating
        appropriately.</li>
      <li>Fixed a small bug in the Java library which didn't correspond
        to the (correct) documentation.</li>
      <li>Bug 18427: in some situations where the UI viewport is small,
        the menu bar would disappear. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 20757: ENAMEX-style tags and attributes didn't work with
        Carafe training on JSON documents. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 23672: the MIME type of log spreadsheets was incorrect
        when saved from the MAT UI, causing Excel to fail to digest the
        logs properly on Windows. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 23668: "Update workspace key" in the UI was failing to
        percolate appropriately to "Open workspace...". Fixed.</li>
      <li>Minor documentation updates.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1.0RC4</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a bug where command-line arguments of MATEngine weren't
        overriding step attributes in the task.xml file. Added
        appropriate tests.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where step attribute defaults weren't being
        postprocessed appropriately.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug in the Java bindings where it was possible to
        create an annotation type with null attributes.</li>

    <h2>1.0RC3</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed minor omission in experiment infrastructure.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where extra task paths were not being
        canonicalized when task directories were being computed.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added a temporary fix, to be backed out in 1.1, to use the
        Carafe engine for the anonymization task in the core
        distribution.</li>

      <li>Minor modifications of the UI log action names to improve
        consistency.</li>
      <li>Bug 19970: because of a deep bug in the interaction between
        Firefox and the UI toolkit when the backend server was down, no
        feedback was being provided to the user about the failure.
        Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 17989: the experiment engine was saving its raw gold files
        as ASCII, rather than a Unicode-compatible encoding like UTF-8.
        Fixed.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Bug 17867: HTML and HTTP escapes were not being inserted
        appropriately in the routines that generate task-specific
        documentation. Fixed.<br>

      <li>Bug 17778: various operations that could be performed in the
        UI weren't blocking out rerequests while the operation was being
        performed. Fixed.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Bug 16039: left click (not swipe) on an annotation while hand
        annotating selected just that token, not the entire annotation.
        Fixed.<br>

      <li>Changed the "inherit_actions" attribute of workspace
        operations in task.xml to "inherit_operations", for consistency.<br>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1.0pre13</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Even more documentation updates.</li>
      <li>Corrected terminology for the deidentification task.</li>
      <li>Fixed MATWeb so that it preserves its workspace key across
        restarts.</li>
      <li>Expanded the Java client library to support workspace
        operations.</li>
      <li>Added branding capability to UI and tasks.<br>

    <ul>
      <li>Vast documentation updates.</li>
      <li>Added a Java client library (not documented yet).</li>

        installation. Fixed.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1.0pre11</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The settings for the Carafe model builder are now specified in
        the task.xml file, and can be overridden in the experiment XML
        or in the workspace settings. As part of this change, the "task"
        attribute to &lt;build_settings&gt; in the experiment XML file
        is no longer recognized.</li>
      <li>Added the MATModelBuilder tool.</li>
      <li>Added the MATManagePluginDirs tool.</li>
      <li>Expanded the documentation.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1.0pre10</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The tabbed terminal is now optional. Build, install and
        runtime have been appropriately updated.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1.0pre9</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The visible name of the rich JSON format in the UI, command
        line, and all configuration and experiment files has been
        changed to "mat-json". This change is in support of future
        additions of other readers and writers for the MAT system.</li>
      <li>The URL with which MAT can be accessed in the Web UI has been
        changed to 'http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/MAT/desktop".</li>
      <li>For any task directory ending with basename &lt;name&gt;, you
        can now access a desktop restricted to that task at
        "http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/tasks/&lt;name&gt;/desktop".</li>
      <li>Initial support for user-friendly demos has been introduced.
        The configuration file for this capability will be documented
        when the capability matures a little more.</li>
      <li>All XML configuration file layouts are now defined by a
        simple, user-readable templating system.</li>
      <li>It is now possible to define user-visible workflow steps which
        consist of sequences of implementations of other steps (e.g.,
        "prep" might implement "zone,tokenize").</li>
      <li>The Web UI is no longer tied as closely to the names of the
        steps in the MAT engine.</li>
      <li>Tasks now support the option of defining "attribute sets" for
        annotations, so that, e.g., an ENAMEX tag with different values
        for the "type" attribute can map to different CSS
        configurations, and be treated differently in the scorer.</li>
      <li>Bug 19240: if a core task was installed using
        MATInstallApplication after a dependent task, and both had
        documentation, the documentation rendering was broken. This has
        been fixed by moving to live, on-line generation of the
        customized documentation.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Bugs 14466, 16090: The tarball distribution contained multiple
        copies of the MAT executables, only one of which was configured
        correctly. All duplications have now been eliminated. As a
        result, all MAT executables in the tarball distribution should
        be accessed from src/MAT instead of build/MAT.</li>
      <li>Bugs 14507, 19391: Previously, there was a separate step to
        install the Web documents in a separate location. That step has
        now been eliminated.<br>

        training models are not forward-compatible with the new engine.
        Models will have to be rebuilt.<br>

        permanent Carafe model to a task file has changed.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Bug 16450: the -prior-adjst argument of Carafe was not
        available for customization in any useful way, even though it
        controls recall/precision bias. Fixed.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Bug 16225: the random zoning option to optimize PSA training
        was available only to resynthesized documents, because it was
        part of the de-identification task. It is now a feature of the
        trainer itself, and the zone tags are temporarily inserted into
        the document immediately before training if PSA training is
        requested.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Major refactor of internal management of steps to support step
        rollback in the backend and address a large number of bugs.</li>
      <li>Bug 18960: switching between workflows wasn't undoing all the
        appropriate UI configuration steps. Fixed.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Bug 18898: After cleaning up the way transformation and
        nomination should work in the de-identification task, changing
        the replacer between the two steps could screw up the
        application of the transformation. Fixed by cleaning up the way
        metadata is handled in the UI and transported to the backend.</li>
      <li>Bug 18849: experiment directory is created incorrectly if it
        doesn't exist when the experiment is started. Fixed.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Bug 18848: Transforming a document in the de-identification
        task would strip all the tags if tokenization had been skipped.
        Fixed by doing a smarter job of figuring out how to postprocess
        transformed documents.</li>
      <li>Bug 18534: hand annotations were not showing up when hand
        annotated documents were reloaded, because of a logic error in
        the relationship between steps done and steps visible. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 18430: hand annotation was erroneously available during
        resynthesis. No longer.</li>
      <li>Bug 18426: the clean step can't be undone, but nothing was
        preventing this. Now raises an error.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Bug 18425: the clean step was not a core step. It is now.</li>
      <li>Bug 17680: the psaTransform step was not being rolled back
        appropriately in one implementation of the de-identification
        task, because it wasn't "really" a transform step. Refactoring
        the step management fixed this.</li>
      <li>Bug 17610: rollback was not supported in the backend engine.
        Fixed. Engine now accepts an --undo_through argument.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Bug 16603, 16604: newlines are preserved during transformation
        in the de-identification task, but the extent of the tags needed
        to be adjusted. In non-clear replacement, the right thing was
        happening by accident, because those documents were being
        tokenized when they shouldn't have been. These documents are now
        (properly) not tokenized, and the extent adjustment is now done
        correctly.</li>
      <li>Bug 14512: if there's only a single task or a single workflow,
        they should not need to be provided. Fixed.<br>

    <ul>
      <li>Bug 18457: a number of closely related bugs in the
        de-identification task conspired to cause document-level
        cacheing of names and name components to fail.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>0.9p1</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added Windows batch scripts to run the various MAT tools
        outside of the MAT controller.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>0.9</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A tiny bug fix to address a problem managing absent Carafe
        models in tasks in delivered tarballs.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>0.9pre13</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Made entire system Unicode-aware. Added guard to ensure that
        Carafe does not currently see non-ASCII-compatible files. Added
        option to pass character encodings to the engine in the UI and
        on the command line.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Improved error reporting in MATEngine.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>0.9pre12</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Upgraded to Yahoo UI Toolkit version 2.6.0.</li>
      <li>Added ability to customize scorer to some degree for various
        tasks.</li>
      <li>Added --debug flag to experiment engine for debugging support.</li>
      <li>Fixed an unreported bug where rerunning the experiment engine
        to regenerate scores when source_corpus_dir was present was
        failing.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Bug 17863: errors in the command line tool weren't reporting
        the file that caused the error for tokenization. Fixing this in
        all cases isn't really possible at the moment, because of the
        way batch processing works, but it's possible in non-batch, and
        should be now fixed.</li>
      <li>Corrected a subtle error in rich document encoding in Python
        where the sequence "\/" wasn't getting decoded correctly by the
        python-cjson library. Migrated to simplejson.</li>
      <li>In the de-identification task, added a simple Java client
        example for the MAT CGI script.</li>
    </ul>
    This version was not released due to subtle Unicode bugs introduced
    by the migration to simplejson.<br>
    <h2>0.9pre11</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Enabled chains of source corpora dependencies in experiment
        engine. This corrected an error where the engine would fail if a
        corpus pointed to a source corpus which itself pointed to a
        source corpus. The only visible consequence of this change is
        that &lt;prep&gt; instructions in these chains are layered; if a
        corpus has a &lt;prep&gt; instruction and a source_corpus_dir
        attribute, the input to the &lt;prep&gt; instruction will be the
        output of any &lt;prep&gt; instructions in the source corpus,
        rather than ignoring the &lt;prep&gt; instruction in the source
        corpus as the system previously did. We know of no system
        deployments which exploited this previous configuration.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Bug 17681: the psaTransform step was being recorded by mistake
        in the transformed document in the de-identification task. The
        system now imposes a more general requirement that steps are
        only recorded on documents modified by side effect, rather than
        freshly produced documents.</li>
      <li>Added the ability to pass a lexicon to the training engine.</li>
      <li>Added the ability to pass an experiment directory to the
        experiment engine.</li>
      <li>Relaxed the requirement that the source_corpus_dir attribute
        in the experiment configuration be an absolute pathname. Now,
        like other paths in the experiment configuration, if it is not
        absolute, the experiment directory will be prepended.</li>
      <li>The experiment engine now copies the experiment XML file into
        the experiment directory, if a file by that name is not already
        present.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>0.9pre10</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Bug 17613: in the de-identification task, a small bug in the
        training engine was causing the training to fail if annotations
        already contained a replacement nomination. Fixed.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Bug 17612: a repeat of bug 16099, where trailing newlines
        aligned tokens with tags incorrectly after replacement. The
        previous fix was slightly incorrect. Fixed.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed an element of inflexibility in the Carafe trainer, which
        didn't permit the command line in the &lt;prep&gt; experiment
        XML tag to support input documents which were rich documents.
        This command line no longer supplies the --input_file_type
        argument automatically, and it must now be provided explicitly
        in the experiment XML file.</li>
      <li>Added the beginnings of an improved test suite (not yet
        documented).<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>0.9pre9</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Bug 16095: Carafe trainer couldn't handle empty lines in the
        file specifying the available tags. Fixed in the experiment
        engine by automatically generating the tag file. As a result,
        the --task arguments are no longer supported in the &lt;prep&gt;
        and &lt;run_settings&gt; command lines in the experiment XML;
        the toplevel &lt;experiment&gt; tag now requires a "task"
        attribute; and the &lt;build_settings&gt; tag no longer accepts
        the "tag_set" attribute.</li>
      <li>Bug 16749: deleting a document window while the document was
        being tagged caused a Javascript error. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 17027: in the UI, it was possible to include trailing or
        leading whitespace in an annotation during hand tagging. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 17028: in the UI, it was possible to swipe from a taggable
        point across an untaggable point to another taggable point. This
        now generates an error to the user.</li>
      <li>Bug 17029: bug 16096 was not completely fixed in 0.9pre6;
        trying to repeat some errorful calls caused the system to hang.
        Fixed.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>0.9pre8</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed minor score accumulation bugs in experiment engine.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>0.9pre7</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed bug where distributions with only a single task defined
        caused an error in the UI.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>0.9pre6</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cleaned up computation of file save paths so the application
        never adds more than one pathname suffix.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Bug 14509: to simplify task descriptions, display
        configuration, Javascript, and CSS files should be automatically
        inherited from their parent tasks. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 14393: modification check was not performed when the task
        changed. This bug was mostly applicable to the old interface,
        but in the new interface, all client changes are tracked, and
        rollback confirmation is presented when any change is undone, or
        when document is closed. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 15856: modification check was not performed when steps
        were undone. Same issue as bug 14393 above. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 16096: various Carafe errors were not being percolated
        back to the client appropriately. Fixed many, many tiny bugs.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>0.9pre5</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added functionality to support customization of core
        documentation to allow incorporation of application-specific
        documentation and application-specific branding.</li>
      <li>Bug 14650: mat_controller.sh was starting up even if the ports
        that its servers needed were taken. Fixed.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>0.9pre4</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Experiment engine now does the right thing when corpora are
        reused and modified in the consuming experiment.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>0.9pre3</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Bug 16099: bracket redaction spans were mistakenly expanded
        over subsequent tokens in some cases. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 16478: zone step in interface was not rolled back
        correctly. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 16098: drop-down menus were obscured by document windows.
        Partially fixed; menu bar can still be partially obscured.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>0.9pre2</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Feature request 16097: Added token-level scoring, better
        alignment for error detail to the scoring engine.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Bug 16255: the experiment engine should switch to
        noninterleaved mode when it detects that some models have
        already been built. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 16256: documentation for training_increment in experiment
        XML documentation was incomplete. Fixed.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>0.9pre1</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>New user interface, based on the Yahoo! UI toolkit, featuring
        a desktop-style interaction with a top menubar and multiple
        moveable, resizeable document panes.</li>
      <li>Bug 15870: annotation popups in Firefox 3 were popping up in
        the lower left corner. Fixed in the new UI.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>0.8RC6</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Expanded UI log facility to record seconds since log start,
        more details about UI annotation popup interaction.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>0.8RC5</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Feature request 15803: Initial support for keyboard
        accelerators in UI annotation popup.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Bug 15826: the UI was mistakenly recording some steps that it
        shouldn't be recording. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 15810: steps in the UI were not changing when the user
        changed the workflow. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 15809: hand annotation was available before zoning was
        applied. In the current system, this could result in
        undigestible data. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 15808: the "Save raw" button for raw documents made no
        sense, and was misleading. Now disabled.</li>
      <li>Bug 15806: tag names were not alphabetized in the annotation
        popup. Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 15807: some annotation names should be white foreground
        text. Easily supported through task specification; tasks
        updated.</li>
      <li>Bug 15814: annotations weren't visible when reloading saved
        rich documents. This bug revealed a number of issues with
        handling the global order of steps across workflows, which have
        hopefully all been addressed.</li>
      <li>Bug 14394: steps update wasn't working when workflow changed.
        Fixed.</li>
      <li>Bug 15815: Unix installation path cannot contain spaces.
        Temporarily fixed by aborting installation, with warning, if
        spaces are in the path.<br>
