# The MITRE Identification Scrubber Toolkit (version 2.0.4)

Note: This is not the official distribution of the MITRE deidentification toolkit. The repository was created just to facilitate its reuse as a benchmark model.

## Background

From the project documentation at: http://mist-deid.sourceforge.net/

> The MITRE Identification Scrubber Toolkit (MIST) is a suite of tools for identifying and redacting personally identifiable information (PII) in free-text medical records. MIST helps you replace these PII either with obscuring fillers, such as [NAME], or with artificial, synthesized, but realistic English fillers.
