<__top>A <ORGANIZATION>People's Power Party</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Thursday a majority of its
members backed Samak <ORGANIZATION>Sundaravej</ORGANIZATION> as prime minister. 

On Tuesday, a constitutional court ruled that Mr. <PERSON>Samak</PERSON> must step down
as prime minister because he had violated the national charter by
hosting a television cooking show while in office. 

The ruling, however, did not block his party from re-electing him
prime minister. 

Parliament is to vote on the nomination Friday.

The renomination could enrage anti-government protestors who demand he
resign. Some political analysts and the business community also oppose
Mr. <PERSON>Samak</PERSON>'s reappointment, fearing it could lead to violence or
economic damage. 

"<PERSON>Samak</PERSON> is a bad idea," said <PERSON>Sunai Pasuk</PERSON>,a representative in <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>
for Human Rights Watch. "There are competent people inside the party -
there are other senior politicians who could have been nominated." 

The <ORGANIZATION>PPP</ORGANIZATION>, which came to office after elections last December, leads a
six-party coalition government. 

The coalition members pledge to stand by the <ORGANIZATION>PPP</ORGANIZATION>, despite weeks of
anti-government protests, which have brought much of the country's
administration to a standstill. 

The opposition, led the People's <ORGANIZATION>Alliance</ORGANIZATION> for Democracy, accuse
Mr. <PERSON>Samak</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>PPP</ORGANIZATION> of acting for former Prime Minister <PERSON>Thaksin
Shinawatra</PERSON>, who was ousted in a coup two years ago. His critics
consider him corrupt and authoritarian. 

Mr. <PERSON>Thaksin</PERSON> fled to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in August to avoid trial on corruption
charges. But Thai news media reported extensively Thursday that
Mr. <PERSON>Thaksin</PERSON> had told <ORGANIZATION>PPP</ORGANIZATION> leaders he wanted Mr. <PERSON>Samak</PERSON> to remain in
office. 

<PERSON>Sunai</PERSON> says if that is true, it would indicate that Mr. <PERSON>Thaksin</PERSON> is
challenging the courts. 

"I could only guess <PERSON>Thaksin</PERSON> might have felt that he and his party have
been hard done by, by the judiciary so this is moment of defiance,"
added <PERSON>Sunai.</PERSON> 

Also Thursday, <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>'s army chief called on the government to
revoke the state of emergency that was imposed last week after clashes
between pro-government and anti-government protestors. 

Opinion polls show a majority of voters favor new elections to end the
political deadlock.
