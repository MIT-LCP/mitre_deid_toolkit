    <h1>The UI and workspace security<br>
    </h1>
    <p>The <a href="MATWeb.html">MAT Web server</a> provides service
      access to workspaces, which the UI subscribes to. Unlike file
      mode, workspace mode is <span style="font-weight: bold;">stateful</span>
      from the point of view of the UI. It is the server, rather than
      the client, which loads and saves the files. However, we don't
      want just anybody to be able to cause the server to perform these
      stateful operations, so the <a href="MATWeb.html">MAT web server</a>
      implements a very simple security mechanism.<br>
    </p>
    <div style="margin-right: 10px; margin-left: 10px; padding-left:
      10px; padding-right: 10px; border: 1px solid black;
      background-color: lightgray">
      <h2>The MAT Web server is NOT SECURE<br>
      </h2>
      <p>The MAT Web server is <span style="font-weight: bold;">not an
          enterprise-secure implementation, and will never be one</span>.
        It does not use SSL; in workspace mode, it does not perform any
        sort of user authentication beyond the workspace key; it does
        not provide any security logging or traceability. You should
        assume that anyone who has access to your network can see your
        Web server traffic, and either observe or (in the case of
        workspaces) overwrite your data.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The MAT Web server doesn't support accounts, logins, or special
      file permissions. Instead, when the server starts, it generates
      and prints a <span style="font-weight: bold;">workspace key</span>.
      This key is a 32-character random alphanumeric sequence. When the
      user wants to interact with the server in workspace mode, the UI
      prompts the user for this key, and transmits it to the server,
      which compares it to the key it generated. If they match,
      workspace mode is enabled; if they don't, it's not. This mechanism
      guarantees that only the person who started the Web server, or
      someone that person has transmitted the workspace key to, can
      access the workspace via that Web server.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In addition, by default, the Web server only allows local clients
      to access workspaces; if you're contacting the Web server from
      another machine, you won't be able to open any workspaces.
      However, you can override this behavior by starting the server
      with the --allow_remote_workspace_access option.</p>
    <p>This mechanism is simple and straightforward. There's no account
      management required, and the server can only be interrogated for
      the workspace key via its command loop, which means that unless
      you have console access to the Web server, you can't discover the
      key.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Refinements<br>
    </h2>
    <p> Permissions aren't issued per workspace; the Web server has
      exactly as much file access as the user who started the Web
      server. As a result, we need to provide the ability to carefully
      circumscribe the workspace access the clients have. So we've added
      the --workspace_container_directory option to the MAT Web server.
      This option can be used to force the Web server to search only the
      directories specified for workspaces. With this flag, although all
      changes are still made with the UID of the user who started the
      Web server, the accessible directories are strictly limited.</p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>The user can provide a workspace key to the Web server rather
      than having one automatically generated. The MAT Web server
      provides a simple command-line option, --workspace_key, for this.
      However, if the user uses this option, the key will be visible in
      Unix process listings. This may be acceptable for single-user
      local access or for testing, but is clearly unacceptable for
      deploying the MAT Web server as a persisent service. To address
      this shortcoming, we've added the --workspace_key_file option to
      the MAT Web server. This file should be UTF-8 text file readable
      only by the user who starts MATWeb. As an added bit of security,
      this mechanism is the only mechanism used when the MAT Web server
      automatically restarts - even if the user originally used the
      --workspace_key option.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If the MAT Web server is being run as a persistent service, it's
      likely that the output of the MAT Web server will be saved to a
      log file using the --output_log option. The workspace key is
      printed to the console when the MAT Web server starts up, so the
      key will be visible in this file. As a precaution, then, whoever
      sets up the MAT Web server should ensure that the output log is
      readable only by the user who starts MATWeb.<br>
