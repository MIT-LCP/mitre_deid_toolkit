<p>The MITRE Identification Scrubber
Toolkit (MIST) is a suite of tools for identifying and redacting
personally identifiable information (PII) in free-text medical
records. MIST helps you replace these PII either with obscuring
fillers, such as [NAME], or with artificial, synthesized, but
realistic English fillers.

<p>For example, MIST can help you convert this document:

<pre class="docsample">
Patient ID: P89474

Mary Phillips is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes.
She arrived at New Hope Medical Center on August 5 complaining
of abdominal pain. Dr. Gertrude Philippoussis diagnosed her
with appendicitis and admitted her at 10 PM.
</pre>

into this:

<pre class="docsample">
Patient ID: [ID]

[NAME] is a [AGE]-year-old woman with a history of diabetes.
She arrived at [HOSPITAL] on [DATE] complaining
of abdominal pain. Dr. [PHYSICIAN] diagnosed her
with appendicitis and admitted her at 10 PM.
</pre>

or this:

<pre class="docsample">
Patient ID: ID586

Sandy Parkinson is a 34-year-old woman with a history of diabetes.
She arrived at Mercy Hospital on July 10 complaining
of abdominal pain. Dr. Myron Prendergast diagnosed her
with appendicitis and admitted her at 10 PM.
</pre>
</div>

<div id="q2_answer" class="answer">

<p>MIST decomposes the deidentification task into two subtasks:
<ul>
  <li>an <span style="font-weight: bold;">annotation</span> subtask,
where the tools of trainable, corpus-based natural language processing are
brought to bear to identify the PII phrases, and</li>

  <li>a <span style="font-weight: bold;">replacement</span> subtask,
where information in the PII phrases is used to generate suitable
replacements, given a chosen replacement strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first subtask is addressed by the MITRE Annotation Toolkit
(MAT),
which is a highly customizable suite of tools for natural language
processing upon which MIST is built. The customizations for MIST itself
address the second subtask. The MIST documentation uses the
terms <span style="font-weight: bold;">annotation</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">tagging</span> interchangeably for the task
of identifying, either by hand or automatically, the PII
phrases in your documents. The labels for your PII types (e.g., NAME,
PHYSICIAN, AGE, DATE) will be the tags that you'll be applying to your
documents.

<div id="q3_answer" class="answer">
<p>MITRE's research program in deidentification is focused on
attempting to reduce the overhead of document deidentification in
order to enable broader sharing of appropriately redacted medical
records, to enhance medical and public health research. Our
government sponsors are interested in these issues as ways of lowering
the cost of health care for the DoD and civilian government
organizations in the future.

<div id="q4_answer" class="answer">
<p>You can download MIST <a href =
"http://sourceforge.net/projects/mist-deid/files/">here</a>.
The current version of MIST is 2.0.4.

<p>While MITRE has no control over what you
do with MIST, we do ask, as a courtesy, that you <a
href="mailto:aberdeen@mitre.org">let us know</a> ahead of time about
any publications you submit which refer to MIST or its performance.
</div>

<div id="q5_answer" class="answer">
<p>MITRE has assigned a BSD license to its contributions to the MIST
toolkit. 

<p>MIST is distributed with a large number of open-source components
which bear similarly liberal licenses. MIST requires specific versions
of some of these tools, and in some cases has modified those packages
to enhance their functionality. The packages and their licenses are:

<ul>
  <li><a href = "http://developer.yahoo.com/yui">The Yahoo UI Toolkit</a> (BSD)
  <li><a href = "http://cherrypy.org">CherryPy</a> (BSD)
  <li><a href = "http://jackson.codehaus.org">Jackson</a> JSON parser (Apache)
  <li><a href = "http://commons.apache.org">Apache Commons</a>
  libraries (Apache)
  <li><a href =
  "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson">simplejson</a>, for Python
  versions before 2.6 and MIST versions before 2.0 (BSD-like)
  <li><a href =
  "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">setuptools</a>, for
  building simplejson (Python Software License)
  <li><a href = "http://junit.org">Junit</a> (IBM)
  <li><a href = "http://labix.org/python-dateutil">python-dateutil</a> (Python)
  <li><a href = "http://code.google.com/p/psutil">psutil</a> (BSD)
</ul>  

<p>MIST is also distributed with a few optional GPL-licensed
components. These components are not central to the
operation of MIST, and we view their inclusion as "mere
aggregation" in GPL parlance (in other words, the GPL license is not
required for MIST as a whole). Those packages are:

<ul>
  <li><a href = "http://materm.sourceforge.net/">mrxvt</a>
  <li><a href =
  "http://software.jessies.org/terminator/">Terminator</a>
  <li><a href = "http://console.sourceforge.net">Console</a>
</ul>

<div id="q6_answer" class="answer">
<p>MIST is a research prototype. It is not intended to be
enterprise-ready: it is not internationalized, it is not configured to work
with enterprise Web capabilities like Tomcat or Apache, it has no
real security model, and it is not designed for 24/7 availability or
replication.

<p>On the other hand, MIST has been under development for
several years, and has been used successfully by a number of
MITRE's research partners to do various deidentification tasks. The
statistical trainer/tagger that provides the core of MIST's
functionality achieved the highest score in the 2006 i2b2 evaluation
of deidentification tools.

<p>If your needs are straightforward and you're comfortable with
research software, MIST may be useful to you. For other situations,
MIST's value is in the design of its approach to the deidentification
task, and we encourage others who are building more enterprise-ready
capabilities to familiarize themselves with the design of MIST.
</div>

<div id="q7_answer" class="answer">
<p>No. MITRE has set up a <a
href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/mist-deid-users">users
mailing list</a> for discussion about  
MIST, but the MIST team does not have the resources to provide open-ended long-term
support for open-source packages. Members of the MIST team may monitor this
list, and may occasionally comment, but cannot be relied upon
for help or advice.

<p>Instead, the MIST team is seeking a government or non-profit partner to
assume continued custodianship of the MIST tool.

<p>Until we locate a custodian, we may, from time to time, post
an updated version of the MIST toolkit. If we do so, we'll announce it
on the users mailing list above.
</div>

<div id="q8_answer" class="answer">
<p>If you're interested in the technical details of MIST and how to
use it, you can read the on-line documentation (best viewed with
Firefox):

<ul>
  <li>version <a href = "current_docs/html/index.html">2.0.4</a>
  (current version)  
  <li>version <a href = "docs_2_0/html/index.html">2.0</a>

    <h2>MIST version history</h2>

<p>The changes listed here apply exclusively to the MIST deidentification capability.
For changes related to the underlying MITRE Annotation Toolkit, see the documentation
for each release. For instance, MAT 2.0 introduced a whole host of changes, including
a new UI, enhanced scorer, and document comparison capabilities. For upgrade notes and
a summary of
the changes in MAT 2.0, see <a href = "current_docs/html/upgrade_notes.html">here</a>; for
a detailed version history, see <a href = "current_docs/html/version_history.html">here</a>.

<p>Note that in order to use MIST 2.0, your task must be
updated. If you obtained your task from us, please contact us for an updated task and
we'll see what we can do; if it turns out that we no longer have the resources to help,
the upgrade notes will be able to help you.

<p>Not also that in order to use MIST 2.0, your workspaces and models must all be updated.
The upgrade notes will tell you how to do that.

  <h3>2.0.2</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a wide range of bugs related to assigned documents and
        the "nominated" and "redacted, raw" and "redacted, rich" folders
        in workspaces.</li>
      <li>Added edit locks for the "nominated" folder for the case where
        files are opened in the UI.</li>
      <li>Added the force_unlock operation to the "nominated" folder.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2.0.1</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Updated the default MIST feature specification file to include
        a lexicon feature, without which --lexicon_dir has no effect.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  
  <h3>2.0</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Code updates for compatibility with MAT 2.0.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>1.3.1</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Created resources for running the replacement engine without
        MIST.</li>
      <li>Created resources for running the replacement engine under
        Jython.</li>
      <li>Modified LOCATION replacement to use the input pattern as a
        seed, in parallel with other replacement types.</li>
      <li>Improved LOCATION processing to eliminate the possibility of
        null replacements.</li>
      <li>Introduced the COUNTRY pattern.</li>
      <li>Refactored management of replacement frequencies and pattern
        specification to simply the engine slightly.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug with replacement key cacheing where names which
        share a last name ended up sharing a replacement.</li>
      <li>Added hospital initials.</li>
      <li>Expanded the OTHER category to capture capitalization status
        and abbrevation status, and support arbitrary resource
        replacement files.</li>
      <li>Ensured that the replacement engine can pass through
        annotations which have no replacement category.</li>
      <li>Ensured that the replacement engine can pass through
        annotations which it is explicitly instructed not to replace.</li>
      <li>Ensured that AGE fillers will never be replaced with
        themselves, and will never be negative.</li>
      <li>Ensured that street numbers never start with 0.</li>
      <li>Ensured that tokenization applies in batch mode to batch
        replacements.</li>
      <li>Removed spurious entries from the nickname file.</li>
      <li>Fixed a long-standing, subtle bug where patterns which are
        repopulated from frequency information were not respecting the
        specified dependencies between pattern attributes when
        determining the order in which these attributes would be
        assigned values. <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>1.3</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved test facility for AMIA.</li>
