    <h2><a name="System_requirements"></a>System requirements</h2>
    <p>This toolkit is designed to run on generic Unix. However, due to
      the difficulties in supporting the possible range of
      configurations, we are testing it, and providing detailed
      installation instructions, only for Linux Ubuntu 9.10. <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: as of 2.0, Cygwin is no
      longer supported, because Python in Cygwin does not include sqlite
      bindings, which are now required for MAT workspaces.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This toolkit depends on a number of external tools which must be
      installed before you install MAT. For the Unix version, they are:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Python, version 2.6 or later. Most of our development is
        currently on 2.7. 3.x is known not to work.</li>
      <li>Java, version 1.6.0_04 or later.<br>
      </li>
      <li>GNU gcc, make, buildutils (optional).</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2><a name="Conventions"></a>Conventions</h2>
    <p>MAT is primarily a Unix-based tool, so many of the conventions
      used here will come from Unix.<br>
    </p>
    <p>We'll show command lines in fixed-width type, in boldface; the
      system output in response will be in normal face:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>% <span style="font-weight: bold;">pwd</span><br>/home/user/Desktop<br></pre>
    <p></p>
    <p>Throughout the documentation, we'll refer to the location of the
      MAT source tree as the variable MAT_PKG_HOME, as in the following
      command:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>% <span style="font-weight: bold;">cd $MAT_PKG_HOME</span><br></pre>
    <p>If you received this distribution as a tar or a zip file,
      MAT_PKG_HOME is the directory src/MAT inside the unpacked zip
      file. If you checked this distribution out of CVS, it will be the
      root directory you checked out via "cvs checkout MAT".<br>
    </p>
    <p>All command lines in this documentation are Unix command lines,
      unless otherwise indicated. The Unix shell assumed is bash. To set
      the MAT_PKG_HOME variable, do this:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>% <span style="font-weight: bold;">export MAT_PKG_HOME=&lt;dir&gt;</span><br></pre>
    <p>where &lt;dir&gt; is the appropriate value for MAT_PKG_HOME.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In some cases, you'll see a backslash followed immediately by a
      line break in command-line examples:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>% <span style="font-weight: bold;">bin/MATEngine --task 'Named Entity' --workflow Demo --steps 'zone,tokenize' \</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">--input_file $PWD/sample/ne/resources/data/raw/voa2.txt --input_file_type raw \</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">--output_file ./voa2_txt.json --output_file_type mat-json</span></pre>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>These backslashes and line breaks are not required parts of the
      command line; they're present simply to enable us to present the
      command line in a reasonable width. If you type them in the bash
      shell, they'll work just fine; you'll get a continuation prompt
      ("&gt;") and you can keep typing. But you can omit them.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">MAT may be installed in
        directories whose paths contain spaces</span>. If you do this,
      you'll likely have to wrap double-quotes around any references to
      MAT_PKG_HOME or subdirectories thereof:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>% <span style="font-weight: bold;">cd "$MAT_PKG_HOME"</span><br>% <span style="font-weight: bold;">ls "$PWD"</span><br></pre>
    <p>If you don't do this, you'll likely encounter bizarre behavior
      due to the path being expanded and split into command-line tokens
      according to the whitespace in the path.<br>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h2><a name="Installation"></a>Installation</h2>
    A clean Ubuntu 9.10 installation is missing a number of packages,
    which someone suitably knowledgeable should install using the
    Synaptic package manager. Those packages are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>python-dev</li>
      <li>libx11-dev</li>
      <li>sun-java6-bin<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once these packages are installed, you may proceed with the
      installation, as follows:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Untar/unzip the distribution (you must have already done that
        to read this).</li>
      <li>In a terminal window, where &lt;toolkit_dir&gt; is the root
        directory of the distribution:<br>
        <pre>% <span style="font-weight: bold;">cd &lt;toolkit_dir&gt;</span><br>% <span style="font-weight: bold;">./install.sh</span><br></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>During the installation, you might be prompted for various paths
      and locations which the toolkit requires.<br>
    </p>
    <p>When the installation is complete, your <a
        href="runtime_env.html">runtime environment</a> will be
      configured for you. The installed directory is <b>not relocatable</b>;
      you must rerun the installer if you move the installation.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Upgrading_dependencies_or_moving_the_"></a>Upgrading
      dependencies or moving the installation</h2>
    <p>If you want MAT to use a new version of Java or Python because
      the Java or Python on your machine has been upgraded and the old
      version is no longer present, just rerun the installer. The
      installer will find the updated versions and reconfigure your
      tools.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If you want to move the MAT installation from one location to
      another on the same machine, just move the toplevel MAT directory
      - it's completely self-contained. If you want to move the MAT
      installation to another machine, the safest thing to do is
      reinstall on that new machine.<br>
    </p>
