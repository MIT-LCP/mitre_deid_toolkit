<h1>MIST: The MITRE Identification Scrubber Toolkit</h1>
<p>The MITRE Identification Scrubber Toolkit (MIST) is a suite of tools
for deidentifying
free-text documents containing personally identifiable information
(PII). MIST helps you replace these PII either
with obscuring fillers, such as [NAME], or with artificial,
synthesized, but realistic English fillers. The transformed documents
you create with this toolkit are more likely to meet the requirements
of your organization for protecting privacy in documents you distribute.<br>
</p>
<p>For example, assume you're given the following document:<br>
</p>
<pre>Patient ID: P89474<br><br>Mary Phillips is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes.<br>She arrived at New Hope Medical Center on August 5 complaining<br>of abdominal pain. Dr. Gertrude Philippoussis diagnosed her<br>with appendicitis and admitted her at 10 PM.<br></pre>
<p>MIST provides facilities for converting this document to something
like this:<br>
</p>
<pre>Patient ID: [ID]<br><br>[NAME] is a [AGE]-year-old woman with a history of diabetes.<br>She arrived at [HOSPITAL] on [DATE] complaining<br>of abdominal pain. Dr. [PHYSICIAN] diagnosed her<br>with appendicitis and admitted her at 10 PM.</pre>
<p>or even to resynthesize an English document replacement like this:<br>
</p>
<pre>Patient ID: ID586<br><br>Sandy Parkinson is a 34-year-old woman with a history of diabetes.<br>She arrived at Mercy Hospital on July 10 complaining<br>of abdominal pain. Dr. Myron Prendergast diagnosed her<br>with appendicitis and admitted her at 10 PM.</pre>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>MIST decomposes the deidentification task into two subtasks:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>an <span style="font-weight: bold;">annotation</span> subtask,
where the tools of trainable, corpus-based language processing are
brought to bear to identify the PII phrases, and</li>
  <li>a <span style="font-weight: bold;">replacement</span> subtask,
where information in the PII phrases is used to generate suitable
replacements, given a chosen replacement strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first subtask is addressed by the MITRE Annotation Toolkit
(MAT),
which is a highly customizable suite of tools for natural language
processing upon which MIST is built. The customizations for MIST itself
address the second subtask. The documentation that follows uses the
terms <span style="font-weight: bold;">annotation</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">tagging</span> interchangeably for the task
of identifying, either by hand or automatically, the PII
phrases in your documents. The labels for your PII types (e.g., NAME,
PHYSICIAN, AGE, DATE) will be the tags that you'll be applying to your
documents.<br>

<h2>What you should do next</h2>
<p>The documentation that follows is approximately in the order you
should review it.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Because MIST is a customization of MAT, you'll be using it via
the MAT tools. The pages in the section "Getting started" will give you
a deeper
understanding how MAT works, as well as the general task it's intended
to support; it will also tell you how to install the software and how
to read the remainder of the documentation.</li>
  <li>The pages in the section "Deidentification customizations" will
tell you how the general principles of MAT are applied to the
deidentification problem, and how MIST extends MAT to address the
replacement problem as well. This section will refer backward to the
general strategies in MAT, as well as forward to the tutorial that
follows. If at any point you aren't sure how something in the
documentation applies to MIST specifically, refer back to the pages in
this section.</li>
  <li>The pages in the section "Tutorial" give you further details
about how to use MAT.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Have fun!<br>
