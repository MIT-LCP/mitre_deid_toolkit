STANDALONE LIBRARIES FOR THE MIST REPLACEMENT ENGINE
----------------------------------------------------

This directory contains tools and examples for running the MIST
replacement engine without the rest of MIST. By design, the MIST
replacement engine has no dependencies on the remainder of MIST. 

You can run the MIST replacement engine in Python, or in Java using
Jython (http://www.jython.org). 

In order to run the MIST replacement engine, you'll need:

- the python/ and resources/ subdirectories of the MIST core task
  (typically, the src/tasks/core directory in your MIST distribution) 

- the python/ and resources/ subdirectories of your own task
  (typically, a directory in src/tasks in your MIST distribution)

- the lib/python subdirectory of this directory

- if you're using Jython, the lib/java subdirectory of this directory

- a defined subclass of
  StandaloneReplacementEngine.StandaloneReplacementEngine for your
  task. This subclass should require no arguments for
  initialization. The AMIA task contains an example of such a subclass
  definition in python/AMIAReplacementEngine.py.

SAMPLE REPLACEMENT SCRIPT
-------------------------

The script bin/docReplace.py illustrates how the standalone
replacement engine can be used. This script can also serve as a
general-purpose test for your replacement engine. For convenience, it
uses MAT JSON as its source format; however, this is purely for
illustration. No MIST or MAT libraries beyond the ones listed above
are used.

Here's an example for AMIA. Let's say you're in src/tasks in the MIST
distribution, which means you have the following directories:

core/python
core/resources
AMIA/python
AMIA/resources
core/standalone/bin

Let's say you have a MAT JSON file appropriate for the AMIA task in
file.json. Then you'd invoke the test script as follows (all examples
in this README are provided for Unix):

% python core/standalone/bin/docReplace.py --task_py_dir AMIA/python \
--task_resource_dir AMIA/resources file.json "clear -> clear" \
core/python core/resources AMIAReplacementEngine AMIAStandaloneReplacementEngine

(The backslashes, as is traditional, indicate a wrapped line.) This
invocation will print to standard output the modified signal, together
with the labels and modified spans of the replaced PII.

BUILDING THE JYTHON JAR
-----------------------

If you want to call the replacement engine from Java, you can use the
Jython library. The MIST Jython JAR file is found in
lib/java/dist/mist_replacer.jar. In order to use it, you must have
Jython installed (we've tested against 2.5.2). 

If you need to rebuild the MIST Jython JAR file (you shouldn't have
to, but just in case), do this:

% cd lib/java/src
% javac -cp <jython_252_jar> org/mitre/mist/replacement/*.java
% jar cf ../dist/mist_replacer.jar org/mitre/mist/replacement/*.class

where <jython_252_jar> is the jython.jar file in your Jython
installation. 

SAMPLE JAVA APPLICATION
-----------------------

The file bin/MISTReplacement.java is an example implementation very
similar to bin/docReplace.py above. I've chosen to rely on the MAT
Java libraries here, because digesting raw JSON in Java is
painful. However, the MAT libraries are NOT required to use the
replacement engine; they're used only to disassemble the example data
file.

Compile the example as follows:

% cd bin
% javac -cp <jython_252_jar>:../lib/java/dist/mist_replacer.jar:<mat_root>/lib/mat/java/lib/jackson-core-lgpl-1.4.3.jar:<mat_root>/lib/mat/java/lib/jackson-mapper-lgpl-1.4.3.jar:<mat_root>/lib/mat/java/java-mat-core/dist/java-mat-core.jar MISTReplacement.java 

where <jython_252_jar> is as above, and <mat_root> is the src/MAT
directory in your MIST distribution. 

Run this example from src/tasks in your MIST distribution similarly to
bin/docReplace.py. Assume the following directories:

core/python
core/resources
AMIA/python
AMIA/resources
core/standalone/bin
core/standalone/lib/python
core/standalone/lib/java

% java -cp core/standalone/bin:<jython_252_jar>:core/standalone/lib/java/dist/mist_replacer.jar:<mat_root>/lib/mat/java/lib/jackson-core-lgpl-1.4.3.jar:<mat_root>/lib/mat/java/lib/jackson-mapper-lgpl-1.4.3.jar:<mat_root>/lib/mat/java/java-mat-core/dist/java-mat-core.jar \
MISTReplacement --task_py_dir AMIA/python --task_resource_dir AMIA/resources \
file.json "clear -> clear" core/standalone/lib/python core/python \
core/resources AMIAReplacementEngine AMIAStandaloneReplacementEngine
